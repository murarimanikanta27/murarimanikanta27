Hello! I'm a tech enthusiast and developer with a deep passion for robotics, IoT, and automation. I started my adventure with tech through micro-controllers and figured out that I really love creating interactive, smart systems. Design Robots, a long distance communication system etc.. I also like to build projects that go beyond the limit of what oyu think is possible.

I most like to work with Arduino and ESP32 platforms, using these tools for make ideas come true. Many of my projects are realized by integrating all sorts of sensors, actuators and wireless communication means to self-aware systems. I have built projects like Bluetooth car through which we control cars by our mobiles, wireless door authentication and home automation using voice in the combination of both Hardware & software with some creativity.

Curiosity and motivation to learn more (not just within technical aspects) I love working in environments where I can tinker, prototype and iteratively improve design. I have an emphasis on collaboration & knowledge sharing as I like to think that the best solutions are married or shared in diverse ideas and through working together.

Hit me up for collaboration and if you want to chat about tech. So, I had been no stranger to a challenge or growing opportunity as it related being a developers.
